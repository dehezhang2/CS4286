## 1. Risk and the impact of security



## 2. Digital Signature

### (a) ElGamal & DSA

* Can these algorithms be used to encrypt a message?
  * These algorithms cannot be used to encrypt messages, because these algorithms are not directly comparing the digest. 
  * For RSA, the role of public key and private key can be changed, which is the reason that it can be used as both encryption and signature algorithm. (we can call this property as duality)
  * For these two algorithms, the role of private key and public key cannot be changed. Therefore, we have to use different computation algorithm for DSA and ElGamal when used in encryption and signature respectively. 
* Main difference in how you verify the validity of the message with these schemes when compared to RSA
  * RSA directly compares the digest of message $M$ during the verification stage
  * ElGamal compares the base raised to the power of digest $g^{H(m)}\equiv y^rr^s(\ mod\ p)$, and DSA compares the base raised to the random selected number with the participation of the digest $g^k \equiv g^{H(m)s^{-1}}g^{xrs^{-1}} (mod\ p\ mod\ q)$. The digest is not directly used for DSA and ElGamal.

### (b) An example of ElGamal

* Set up: 

  * Base $g = 7$

  * Private key $x = 16$

  * Modular $p = 71$

  * Public key $y = g^x\ mod\ p = 7^{16}\ mod\ 71 = 19$

    ```
    16 = 2^4
    7^(2^1) mod 71 = 7^2 mod 71 = 49
    7^(2^2) mod 71 = 49^2 mod 71 = 58
    7^(2^3) mod 71 = 58^2 mod 71 = 27
    7^(2^4) mod 71 = 27^2 mod 71 = 19
    ( 19 ) mod 71 = 19
    ```

* Sign: 

  * Random $k = 9$

  * $r = g^k \mod\ p = 7^{9}\ mod\ 71 = 47$

    ```
    9 = 2^3 + 2^0
    7^(2^1) mod 71 = 7^2 mod 71 = 49
    7^(2^2) mod 71 = 49^2 mod 71 = 58
    7^(2^3) mod 71 = 58^2 mod 71 = 27
    ( 7 * 27 ) mod 71 = 47
    ```

  * Digest $H(m) = 13$

  * $s = (H(m)-xr)k^{-1}\ mod\ (p-1)$ 

    * Find $k^{-1}(mod\ (p-1)) = 9^{-1}\ (mod\ 70)$
      $$
      70 = 9*7+7 \\
      9 = 7*1+2 \\
      7 = 2*3 + 1\\
      1 = 7 - 2*3 \\
      1 = 7 - (9 - 7)*3 = 7*4 - 9*3\\
      1 = (70-9*7)*4 - 9*3 = 70*4 - 9*31\\
      9^{-1}\equiv 39\ (mod\ 70) \\
      $$

    * Find $s$
      $$
      s = (H(m)-xr)k^{-1}\ mod\ (p-1) \\
      = (13 - 16*47)*39\ mod\ 70 \\
      = 19
      $$

  * Send the signature as $(r,s) = (47, 19)$, as well as message $M$

* Verify:

  * $0<47<71$, $0 <19< 70$

  * $g^{H(M)}\ mod\ p = 7^{13}\ mod\ 71 = 28$

    ```
    13 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0
    7^(2^1) mod 71 = 7^2 mod 71 = 49
    7^(2^2) mod 71 = 49^2 mod 71 = 58
    7^(2^3) mod 71 = 58^2 mod 71 = 27
    ( 7 * 58 * 27 ) mod 71 = 28
    ```

  * $y^r r^s\ mod\ p = 19^{47}*47^{19}\ mod\ 71$

    * $19^{47}\ mod\ 71 = 9$

      ```
      47 = 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0
      19^(2^1) mod 71 = 19^2 mod 71 = 6
      19^(2^2) mod 71 = 6^2 mod 71 = 36
      19^(2^3) mod 71 = 36^2 mod 71 = 18
      19^(2^4) mod 71 = 18^2 mod 71 = 40
      19^(2^5) mod 71 = 40^2 mod 71 = 38
      ( 19 * 6 * 36 * 18 * 38 ) mod 71 = 9
      ```

    * $47^{19}\ mod\ 71 = 11$

      ```
      19 = 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^1
      47^(2^1) mod 71 = 47^2 mod 71 = 8
      47^(2^2) mod 71 = 8^2 mod 71 = 64
      47^(2^3) mod 71 = 64^2 mod 71 = 49
      47^(2^4) mod 71 = 49^2 mod 71 = 58
      ( 47 * 8 * 58 ) mod 71 = 11
      ```

    * $y^r r^s\ mod\ p = 19^{47}*47^{38}\ mod\ 71 = 9*11 \ mod\ 71 = 28$

    * Therefore, the message is successfully verified

## 3. Mutual Authentication

### (a)

* This protocol is vulnerable to **man-in-the-middle attack**

* When Alice sends $R$ to Bob, Trudy can intercept it and send to Bob, Bob send $[R]_B$ to Trudy, then Trudy sends it to Alice. Alice sends $[R+1]_A$ again intercepted by Trudy, and Trudy sends it to Bob. Alice and Bob do not know the existence of Trudy. (Shown as bellow as well as another method to attack)

### (b)

* To achieve mutual authentication, we can replace the second message by $R_A||[R_A||R_B||B]$, and replace the third message by $[R_B||R_A||A]_B$, where $A, B$ are identifier of Alice and Bob respectively, and $R_A, R_B$ are random number generated by Alice and Bob respectively.
