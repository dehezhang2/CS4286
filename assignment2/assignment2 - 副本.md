## 1. Risk and the impact of security



## 2. Digital Signature

* Can these algorithms be used to encrypt a message?
  * These algorithms cannot be used to encrypt messages
* Main difference in how you verify the validity of the message with these schemes when compared to RSA
  * The digest is not directly used in DSA and ElGamal
* An example of 

## 3. Mutual Authentication

### (a)

- This protocol is vulnerable to **man-in-the-middle attack**

- The reason of it is not secure is $R+1$ is predictable, therefore freshness is not satisfied. 

- When Alice sends $R$ to Bob, Trudy can intercept it and send to Bob, Bob send $[R]_B$ to Trudy, then Trudy sends it to Alice. Alice sends $[R+1]_A$ again intercepted by Trudy, and Trudy sends $[R+1]_T$ to Bob. Alice and Bob do not know the existence of Trudy. (Shown as bellow as well as another method to attack)

### (b)

- Assume all the public keys are certificated by trusted CA
- To achieve mutual authentication, we can replace the messages by
  - $R_A$
  - $R_B||[R_B||R_A||B||A]_B$
  - $[R_A||R_B||A||B]_A$ 
  - where $A, B$ are public available identifier of Alice and Bob respectively, and $R_A, R_B$ are random number generated by Alice and Bob respectively. By using the identifier to add the information of sender and receiver, man-in-the-middle attack does not work
- This protocol also protect from replay attack when one of Alice and Bob is using poor random number generation (i.e. one of them is repeating use one nonce)
- This protocol also protect from replay attack when Alice and Bob are using counter as nonce by changing the order of the two nonce in the signature.
